# 🎯 Strategy Pattern Implementation in TypeScript

## 📖 Overview

This project demonstrates the **Strategy Design Pattern** in TypeScript, showcasing how to dynamically switch between different algorithms (like mathematical operations) at runtime.

## 🌟 Features

- Clean TypeScript implementation
- Easy-to-extend structure
- Runtime strategy switching
- SOLID principles compliant

## 🚀 Getting Started

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18+)
TypeScript (v4.9+)
pnpm (optional)

## 🏆 Best Practices

- Use interfaces to define strategy contracts
- Keep strategies focused on a single operation
- Use dependency injection for strategy configuration
- Document each strategy's purpose clearly
